ðŸ‘‹ Hey Will Macaskill,

It's your boy Josh Stroud with the latest and greatest in AI ideas for a better world. I think you need to hear this...

When I was in college, I wanted to change the world. So I went to UC Berkeley, and majored in engineering. I started a company, and the journey began...

As I grew older, I realized there was more to life than working hard. I wanted a girlfriend, a wife, someone who completed me  - So I met someone special, and began the journey of building the relationship :)

As 30-somethings, we've had the same journey in AI, ethics, and service - We've had a mission to save the world, make a difference, and be smart. To use our heads and our hearts to change things, as we wish to change things :)

Will Macaskill, it's time to move to San Francisco and change the world. The world needs you - Step up as a leader, and change the things * you * care about. #Startups #SanFrancisco :)

Startup adventures start small, with an angel investor who believes in you - Find that person, raise a round, and build your company. You're worth it :)
